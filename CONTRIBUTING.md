# Contributing to Medical CV Research Agent

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/research-viz-agent.git`
3. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate it: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
5. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Install in development mode: `pip install -e .`

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. Make your changes
3. Test your changes (see Testing section)
4. Commit with clear messages: `git commit -m "Add feature X"`
5. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
6. Open a Pull Request

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and concise
- Add type hints where appropriate

Example:
```python
def search_papers(
    self,
    query: str,
    max_results: int = 10
) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Search for papers.
    
    Args:
        query: Search query string
        max_results: Maximum number of results
        
    Returns:
        List of paper dictionaries
    """
    pass
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_mcp_tools.py

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=research_viz_agent tests/
```

### Test Individual Tools

```bash
# Test MCP tools without OpenAI API
python tests/test_tools_standalone.py
```

### Writing Tests

- Add tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Aim for good code coverage
- Use mocks for external API calls in unit tests

## Adding New Features

### Adding a New Research Source

1. Create a new tool in `research_viz_agent/mcp_tools/`
2. Follow the pattern of existing tools (ArxivTool, PubMedTool, etc.)
3. Implement:
   - `__init__()`: Initialize the tool
   - `search_papers()` or similar: Main search method
   - `search_medical_cv_models()`: Domain-specific search
4. Add the tool to the workflow in `research_workflow.py`
5. Update documentation

### Improving Summarization

1. Modify prompts in `research_workflow.py`
2. Adjust the `_prepare_context()` method to include more/different information
3. Test with various queries

### Adding CLI Options

1. Edit `research_viz_agent/cli.py`
2. Add new arguments to the argument parser
3. Pass arguments to the agent
4. Update documentation

## Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update docs/API.md for API changes
- Update docs/CONFIGURATION.md for config changes
- Add examples for new features
